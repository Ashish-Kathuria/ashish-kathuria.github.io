Before moving further, we should have a unix machine with root access. Examples on this website can be replicated on a unix machine, which has docker installed for some cases.

If you do not have a linux machine, you can get one on any cloud vendor's platform, which is generally free for 1 year.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers an ubuntu VM, with 1 GB RAM free for 1 year under `Google Cloud Free Tier`. GCP also gives $300 free, which can be used for 1 year. This amount can be used to add more RAM to the VM. See this [link](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier) for details. Go through this link carefully, to avoid any unexpected charges. Terms and conditions may be changed by GCP anytime.
